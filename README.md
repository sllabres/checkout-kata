## Checkout Kata

Originally found here: https://rubygem.me/2014/01/16/shopping-cart-kata/

Implement the code for a supermarket checkout that calculates the total price of a number of items. Goods are priced individually, however there are weekly special offers for when multiple items are bought. For example “Apples are 50 each or 3 for 130”.

Weekly offers change frequently.


| SKU | Quantity | Special Offer |
|-----|----------|---------------|
| A99 | 50       | 3 for 130     |
| B15 | 30       | 2 for 45      |
| C40 | 60       |               |
| T34 | 99       |               |

The checkout accepts the items in any order, so that if we scan a pack of Biscuits, an apple and another pack of biscuits, we’ll recognise two packs of biscuits and apply the discount of 2 for 45.

### Javascript

```javascript
var Checkout = function(){
  function total(){
  }
   
  function scan(item){

    scan: scan,
    total: total
  };
};
```
